# Problem 054 - Poker Hands

This is my first introduction to the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) challenges.

My friend and former colleague, [Ben Pierson](https://github.com/bpierson11) shared the challenge and his solution, and inspired me to try a different approach.

The basic structure I laid out for myself was:
1. Read in the data
2. Split the data to two poker hands
3. Evaluate the hands for hand rank
4. Compare the evaluations
5. Assign a winner
6. Count the winning hands in loop

I was pleased with how the initial coding was going. However, not enough thought was given to step 3. Step 3 turned into a giant mess of nested if clauses that I don't like. Test cases were needed just to be sure I was traversing it correctly. Not ideal!

Overall, I  got the correct answer and had some sections that I like, and I want more iterations in the planning phase on the next one.

p.s. [Ben's solution](https://github.com/bpierson11/poker_hands) was faster, mine was fewer lines ("who cares!?" I hear them shout, and I agree).
